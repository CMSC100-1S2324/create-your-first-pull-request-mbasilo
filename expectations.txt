I expect a course that will allow me to explore new options in web development for both front and back end. Also, I hope to have fun and actually finish this course this time. My hope is that the course is engaging and fun so that the process of learning just comes naturally.

Your expectation, might deceive, your reality. But wow, such good expectation, 10/10.
